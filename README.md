# Spatial-and-temporal-cross-validation-strategy-for-misbehavior-detection-in-C-ITS

This repository contains the source code of the experiments done in the paper Spatial-and-temporal-cross-validation-strategy-for-misbehavior-detection-in-C-ITS.
It also contains additional information about the data. see data/Spatial_and_temporal_cross_validation_strategy_for_misbehavior_detection_in_C_ITS__appendix_.pdf

To redo the experiments from the paper, run the jupyter notebook from the root (VEREMI misbehavior detection.ipynb).

Note that the experiments take a long time to run depending on the cluster performances. One can set # df=df.sample(frac=0.01) a the beginning of the notebook to give it a quick check and run all cells successfully before running for the whole dataset.
