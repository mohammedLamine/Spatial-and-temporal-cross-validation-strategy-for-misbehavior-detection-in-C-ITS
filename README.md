# Spatial-and-temporal-cross-validation-strategy-for-misbehavior-detection-in-C-ITS

This repository contains the source code of the experiments done in the paper Spatial-and-temporal-cross-validation-strategy-for-misbehavior-detection-in-C-ITS.
It also contains additional information about the data. see data/Spatial_and_temporal_cross_validation_strategy_for_misbehavior_detection_in_C_ITS__appendix_.pdf

To redo the experiments from the paper, run the jupyter notebook from the root (VEREMI misbehavior detection.ipynb) 

the data is also provided and is from:
